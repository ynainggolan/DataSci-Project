<h2>Overview:</h2>
    <p>
        The objective of this project is to infer the safety of NYC.
        By exploring the different causes of mortality, we should be able to infer the 
        situation in NYC and the five borough. The question that I want to answer is 
        whether or not NYC is a relatively safe place to live. Should the residents of 
        NYC be more wary of other, or should they consult more with other due to depression
        and stress, or should they be taking more percautions of to prevent themselves from 
        getting sick.

<h2>The Leading Causes:</h2>
    <p>
        By using the "New_York_City_Leading_Causes_Of_Death.csv" I am able to get
        all of the leading causes of death that has been recorded since 2007 to 2019.
        Using the same dataset it is also possible to categorize the causes into three
        categories: Self, Others, and Diseases. The "Self" is when the causes of death is 
        the person itself, whether it be done by self harming or overdosing. The "Others"
        is when the cause of death is done by other people, whether it be homicide or 
        accidents. Then the "Disease" is death caused by diseases whether it be cureable or 
        non-curable.

            * {
              box-sizing: border-box;
            }
            
            .column {
              float: left;
              width: 33.33%;
              padding: 5px;
            }
            
            /* Clearfix (clear floats) */
            .row::after {
              content: "";
              clear: both;
              display: table;
            }
            </style>
            </head>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
              <img src="Graphs/Relative Death Count.png" alt="Relative Death Count" style="width:100%">
            </div>
            <div class="column">
              <img src="Graphs/Self vs. Others vs. Diseases.png" alt="Relative Death Count" style="width:100%">
            </div>
          </div>
        In the image above we can see the frequency of cause of death being recorded throughout 2007 to 2019 (top).
        It is clear that the most frequent cause of death in NYC is diseases. Not only is it more frequent 
        but it also have more kinds of diseases that is being recorded. Whereas the self and other being the 
        cause of death, both of them are relatively equal throughout 2007 to 2019. But, what is interesting is that 
        the "Self" as a cause of death has increases whereas "Others" has decreased, as can be seen on the bottom graph.  
        Although the change in trend is comparatively small in comparison to the overall death, it is still concerning
        that more people is dying due to themselves since 2014 to 2020. We know that in 2020 drastic change
        has been made due to the global pandemic that is happening, and it seems that NYC populace becomes more 
        burdened by the change which resulted in the increase of death done by themselves. Also a possible decrease in death due 
        to other in 2020 is the fact that there is a lock down, which prevent other from interacting with each other physically as much.

      <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <img src="Graphs/diseases regression line.png" alt="Relative Death Count" style="width:100%">
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img src="Graphs/self regression line.png" alt="Relative Death Count" style="width:100%">
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img src="Graphs/others regression line.png" alt="Relative Death Count" style="width:100%">
        </div>
      </div>
      Then on this graphs we can see the predictions of the three different causes of death. These three graphs shows the most contributed
      factor in the amount of death in NYC. As can bee see clearly it is Diseases, an the line on the graph suggested that it continue to 
      be the most contributing cause. Meanwhile the other two graphs, "Self" and "Others", shows that they increasing ever so slightly
      on the graph; although the regression line predicts that they will contribute less as the cause of death. But it is clear that 
      disesases are reulilng in the cause of death in NYC.

<h2>Car Crashes</h2>
    <p>
        Now that we have taken a look on the general cause of death in NYC let us analyze more on "Others" as the cause,
        more specifically motor vehicle. Since car accidents are rampant throught the country and it is a cause where people can collectively 
        prevent. 
        <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
              <img src="Graphs/Killed vs. Injured on Collisions.png" alt="Killed vs. Injured On Collision" style="width:100%">
            </div>
            <div class="column">
              <img src="Graphs/Killed vs. Injured.png" alt="Killed vs. Injured" style="width:100%">
            </div>
          </div>
        As the graph above shows there are a significant amount of car crashses in NYC and yet not many casualties. This shows that 
        although car crashes are rampant, the casualties it causes aren't that significant. However, although it is not significant
        the casualties of car crashes are fairly consistent. As can be seen on the graph to the left, there are a significant drop 
        in car crashes between 2019 to 2021 and yet the casualties it produces are consistent. Which can be infered that the
        the amount of people getting killed is quite consistent no matter the amount of collision; while the amount of people injured 
        is proportionate to the amount of collisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
          <img src="Graphs/INJURED.png" alt="Killed vs. Injured On Collision" style="width:100%">
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <img src="Graphs/KILLED.png" alt="Killed vs. Injured" style="width:100%">
        </div>
      </div>
      These graphs shows the trends of the total amount of people injured or killed based on the number of collisions per year. 
      The graphs shows a positive regression line, meaning in the future the amount of people getting killed or injured based 
      on the number of collisions will increases. Although the two previous graph made kind of shows us that number of peole killed
      is quite static while the amount of peole injured is proportionate to the amount of collisions, these graphs shows that 
      both of them are in an increasing trend.

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
    <p>
      After looking at all of these graphs we can infer that NYC is relative low in crime, the people are tough and not easy to give
      up on living, and it is a place where you have to be careful of your health. We can see form the "Leadig Cause" graph that 
      the most frequent cause of death is done by diseases that is preventable.
